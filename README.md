iTop experimental generic redundancy class

This is an experimental class for adding generic redundancy processing to
Combodo iTop. It was developed under V 2.6.0; I do not know if it will run under
earlier versions. Full documentation is in "Experimental generic redundancy object Alternative.pdf".
